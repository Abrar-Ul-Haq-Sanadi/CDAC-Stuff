I agree
It is just that, going by our history of
 interactions with Eileen ma'am, 
we didn't go to her through Swati ma'am earlier,
 to postpone the ppt activity till tomorrow. We discussed it with her directly, and had it shifted. 
I was going by that, and had that as a better way of solving the issue in my mind.

Please don't mind my inactivity on the official group.

I empathize well with our students residing in Panchvati. I hope, our informing ma'am indeed helps in pushing the date ahead.

Never mind.
“College students need to be very careful that they understand whether 
or not their parents are eligible to claim them as a dependent,” 
says Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government 
relations at the American Assn. of Tax Professionals. Merely not claiming a dependent does not make that taxpayer independent, he says.

Claim all eligible college and other education tax credits

There are two kinds of education tax credits. 
The American Opportunity Credit is for up to $2,500 a year 
(based on spending at least $4,000 on tuition, 
books and fees) for the first four years toward an undergraduate degree.

The second, the Lifetime 
Learning Credit, can be used toward an 
undergraduate, graduate or professional 
degree and is for up to $2,000 (based on 20% of qualifying education expenses).

A parent cannot claim both credits for the same dependent child on a return 
in the same year; nor can a student who files. 
If there are multiple dependents on a parent’s return, both credits may be used so long as just one is claimed for each student.

Are you finding it challenging to view file content in Linux? 
You’re not alone. Many users find themselves puzzled when it comes to handling large text files in Linux,
 but luckily there is a tool that can help. 
Think of the ‘more’ Linux command as a powerful 
telescope – allowing you to inspect file content page by page, providing a versatile and handy tool for various tasks.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of using the ‘more’ command in Linux,
 from its basic usage to more advanced techniques. We’ll cover everything from viewing single and multiple files, searching within the file, 
to alternative approaches and troubleshooting common issues.

Let’s get started and master the ‘more’ command in Linux!
TL;DR: How Do I Use the ‘More’ Command in Linux?

    The 'more' command in Linux is used to view the contents of a file in a page-by-page manner.
 You can use it with the syntax, more [options] filename.txt. This command will display the contents of ‘filename.txt’ page by page.


In this example, the ‘more’ command displays the contents of ‘myfile.txt’ on your screen. 
The output is the first few lines of the file, and you can press the space bar or Enter to view the next page of the file.
Advantages of ‘More’

The ‘more’ command is particularly useful when dealing with large files. 
It allows you to digest the file’s contents in bite-sized chunks rather than overwhelming you with the entire content at once.
Potential Pitfalls

While the ‘more’ command is incredibly useful, it does have its limitations. For instance, it only allows you to navigate 
forwards through a file, not backwards. If you miss something and want to go back, you’d have to exit and re-open the file.

In the next section, we’ll discuss more advanced uses of the ‘more’ command and how to overcome some of these limitations.
